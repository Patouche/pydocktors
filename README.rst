------------
What is it ?
------------

On top of docker, pydocktors is a simple way to declare a decorator to start and shutdown a docker container.

---------------
Why to use it ?
---------------

You can use it anywhere you want in your python code ! This include test and code...

For example, if you have a application that require a database (for example, MySQL or Neo4J) but you don't want to install the database globally on your system, you can use the docker decorator !

Or you may need to load a application such as Nginx or Eureka when running your code locally without installing it, this docker decorator is made for you !

--------
Examples
--------

All of them are also available in the `examples <./examples/README.md>`_. Each example are designed to be independent.

Starting a Nginx with a your content and your configuration::

    @docktors.docker(
        inject_arg=True,
        image='nginx',
        ports=[(80, 8080)],
        volumes=[
            (TARGET_DIR, '/usr/share/nginx/html', 'ro'),
            (NGINX_CONF, '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf', 'ro')
        ],
        wait_for_port=8080,
    )
    def main(container):
        logger.info(
            'Nginx container with id %s is %s. Visit http://localhost:8080/',
            container.id, container.status
        )

FAQ

Why this name ?
    Because it's the contraction of 3 famous words : *python*, *docker* and *decorators*

How did it came from ?
    It will be a shame if a told you that I didn't take inspiration from other Open Source project...
    In fact, as a Java developper, I was aware of this 2 projects :

    - `docker-junit-rule <https://github.com/geowarin/docker-junit-rule>`_
    - `junit5-docker <https://github.com/FaustXVI/junit5-docker>`_

    But after some research, I wonder why there was no python decorator already made to run docker in python scripts.
    So, for my needs, I decided to do one and to share it !

    I hope that it will be helpful for you to.
